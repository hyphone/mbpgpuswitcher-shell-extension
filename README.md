__mbp5linux Shell Extension__

This shell extension for GNOME 3 only works with my skrits to switch between the integrated and dedicated GPU on a MacBook Pro with dual NVIDIA GPUs.

The shell extension removes the requirement to open the terminal so it's possible to switch to the desired GPU from the GUI.
A reboot is still required because of the limitations to the not-available-NVIDIA-support for the Apple GMUX.
